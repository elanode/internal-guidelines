## Solving Issue Workflow

### Starting Steps

To start working on your assigned issue (*Must be in **TO DO** status first*): 

1. Switch the issue status to `In Progress`.

2. On your local project `main` branch, `git pull origin main`
3. Create new branch, `git checkout -b [feat/fix/hotfix]/[simple-issue-name]/ELA-[issue_number]_dev_main`
    - Example: `git checkout -b feat/landing-page/ELA-001_dev_main`
    - Notice the `dev_main`
5. After creating `dev_main` branch, make new branch for the specific task `git checkout -b [feat/fix/hotfix]/[simple-issue-name]/ELA-[issue-number]_[simple-descriptive-task-name]`
    - Example: `git checkout -b feat/landing-page/ELA-001_banner_carousel_component`
    - Notice the `banner_carousel_component`
6. You can start developing at that `"banner_carousel_component"` branch 

### Making Pull Request

Assigned dev, should only make Pull Request to his/her own `dev_main` branch.

Here, we will use from previous section example branch.

1. Push both `feat/landing-page/ELA-001_dev_main` & `feat/landing-page/ELA-001_banner_carousel_component` branches to the project.
2. On the pull request menu, *New pull request* then set **base section** to your `dev_main` branch, and **compare section** to your `banner_carousel_component` branch
3. Add your project lead as **reviewer** to your pull request.
